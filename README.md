# Construction Sticks #

## About ##
**Construction Sticks** allow you to place multiple blocks at once, up to 1024 at a time, extending your build in the direction you're facing. You can upgrade your stick to enhance its abilities, making construction faster and more efficient.

### Sticks ###
There are five different tiers of Construction Sticks: Wood, Copper, Iron, Diamond, and Netherite. Each tier offers improved durability and block placement abilities, and can be further upgraded with templates.

### Upgrade Templates ###
Templates add special upgrades to your Construction Sticks. To apply a template, combine the stick, template, and an additional item in a Smithing Table.

### Available Templates: ###
- **Angel:** Place blocks behind the ones you're facing or in mid-air.
- **Destruction:** Remove blocks quickly and efficiently.
- **Unbreakable:** Removes durability consumption, allowing infinite block placement.
- **Battery:** Lets the stick use RF instead of durability.

### Additional Features ###

- **Shulker Boxes, Bundles, and Other Containers:** Use them as sources for building blocks.
- **Botania Compatibility:** Use the Black Hole Talisman or Rods for infinite resources at the cost of Mana.
- **Offhand Placement:** Place blocks from your offhand instead of the one you're looking at.
